This part gets the length of the space between LocatorA and LocatorB, and then divides it by the width of the stairs-
#and rounds it to the nearest integer. This determines the number of stairs that will be generated.

OK.


I have two points in 3D space, point A and point B. I want to place items at regular intervals along a straight line between those two points. 

The number of intervals = the distance between the points divided by the width of the items and rounded to the nearest integer.


I = rounded (D/W)


The items are numbered. The lowest numbered item should be placed at whichever point has a lower Y value. 


The distance may not equal the distance between the points divided by the width of the items and rounded to the nearest integer; it may be slightly
less or greater than. If this is the case, 


item number * (y dist / the number of intervals)
item number * (x dist / the number of intervals)






this is harder than i thought


the X of the stairs should = The width of the stairs already put out


the distance is from a
